# AirCrash-Fatalities-Prediction

#### The goal of this project is to predict the fatalities in Air crashes. 

In this we have taken two different datasets and merged them into a single dataset. Performed EDA, Feature Engineering and then Trained model on different Algorithms like Linear regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree. And finally performed the Hyperparameter Tuning, Optimization techniques.
